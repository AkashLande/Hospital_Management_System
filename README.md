# Hospital_Management_System
Hospital Management System is a web application for the hospital which manages doctors and patients. 
In this project, I use Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL technologies. The entire project mainly consists of 3 modules, which are Admin module, User module, Doctor module.
Admin section can add or delete doctors info as per their specialization and also view all the appointments and their status. 
User section can register the appointments to their specialist doctor based on disease and also view status of the appointment. 
Doctor section can view their assigned patient list and depending on treatment they can change the status of appointments.
